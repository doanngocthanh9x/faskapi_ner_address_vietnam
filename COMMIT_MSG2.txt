fix: Add auto model download with complete file verification

- Add docker-entrypoint.sh to auto-download models on container start
- Check for all required files: .onnx, .onnx.data, config.json
- Update download_model.py to download entire folder from Google Drive
- Fix Pydantic warning by setting protected_namespaces = ()
- Increase health check start_period to 40s for model download
- Add fix_models.sh script for manual model re-download
- Add QUICKSTART.md with comprehensive deployment guide
- Verify model files after download with size display

This ensures the container can run standalone without manual model download,
and all required ONNX Runtime files (.onnx.data) are present.
